# Javier
Javier is a minecraft server launcher that is intended for those who have multiple servers in a folder, but only run 1 at a time

If you only have 1 server, and need a quick and easy server launcher that applies to (hopefully) everything, then you should swap over to the old but still useful [master branch](https://github.com/Neeko-iko/JavierLauncher/tree/master)

# FAQ

> Do I have to enter the RAM value each time I launch a server?
 
No, that's only to update the JSON incase you want to decrease or increase the RAM for the server.
 
 
> Javier crashes upon launch!

Did you rename the JSON Javier pulls from?  Did you clear the JSON to be empty?  Does Javier have any server folders to see?

  
  
  
> I wanna make my own theme!

Glad to hear it! you can make as many themes as you want in the JSON just use the following format
  
  "Name of theme":["text color in hex", "background color in hex"]
  
  example: 
  ` "Light": ["#161719","#FFFFFF"]`
  
  
  
  
> Javier doesn't change themes when I click the buttons!

  Javier has to be restarted for the theme change to take affect.
