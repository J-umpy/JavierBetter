# Javier
Javier is a minecraft server launcher that is intended for those who have multiple servers in a folder, but only run 1 at a time

If you only have 1 server, and need a quick and easy server launcher that applies to (hopefully) everything, then you should swap over to the old but still useful [Javier LITE](https://github.com/Neeko-iko/JavierLauncher/tree/LITE) which is maintained by [Jumpy](https://www.github.com/jumpyvonvagabond) in her free time.
if you want a working build of Javier that has features, check out the [GUI](https://github.com/Neeko-iko/JavierLauncher/tree/GUI) branch


Thank you for your continued support.


# Libraries/Modules and Tools Used

Developed with Python 3.10 on Debian
Using VSCode for Code editing
Using QTDesigner for designing the UI

 - QT for the GUI (PySide6)
 - OS for finding servers and launching them (at your command)



# FAQ
> is Javier-QT available as a windows executable file?

not at the moment. if you want to run it, you'll have to install QT (PySide6 is the package im using) on your local machine and run Javier.py from your terminal (or by double clicking, how fancy)
i'll make a Windows, MacOS, and Linux executable when it's up-to-snuff with GUI version 1.6 or later. 

> Why not just continue the old (GUI) build?

Tkinter, which is what the GUI build uses, is fine as a starter, but using it now is tiresome and the way i've structured it is so insanely terrible that it would genuinely be more efficient to restart.  Assuming i even keep up with the project.

> Why is progress slow?

Pessimism to the project causes me to not want to work on it, followed by burnout from working a software engineering job.
