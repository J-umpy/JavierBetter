# Javier
Javier is a minecraft server launcher that is intended for those who have multiple servers in a folder, but only run 1 at a time

If you only have 1 server, and need a quick and easy server launcher that applies to (hopefully) everything, then you should swap over to the old but still useful [Javier LITE](https://github.com/Neeko-iko/JavierLauncher/tree/LITE) which is maintained by [Jumpy](https://www.github.com/jumpyvonvagabond) in her free time.
if you want a working build of Javier that has features and isn't too overly unstable, check out the [GUI](https://github.com/Neeko-iko/JavierLauncher/tree/GUI) branch


Thank you for your continued support.
