# Javier
Javier is a minecraft server launcher that is intended for those who have multiple servers in a folder, but only run 1 at a time

If you only have 1 server, and need a quick and easy server launcher that applies to (hopefully) everything, then you should swap over to the old but still useful (master branch)[https://github.com/Neeko-iko/JavierLauncher/tree/master]
